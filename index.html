	 			<p>UCA has been a home of wide-open opportunities for me since I got here. It has also been a life changing school. One of the most amazing opportunities that I given was to represent UCA at President Obama’s swearing in ceremony in Washington DC. UCA is a family where parents and friends are all around you.</p>
