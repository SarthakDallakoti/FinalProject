			<h2>Certificate Holder</h2>
			<p>While the identity of Lady Whistledown may have been one of 2021’s most delicious secrets, the author of the Bridgerton novels has been on must-read lists for decades. At least her pseudonym has, ever since she first adopted it before she started medical school. As Julia Quinn, she’s made such a name for herself that even her family often calls her “JQ” in group chats. Her University's classmates may know her better as Julie Cotler ’92, who spent her time on campus living in Pennypacker and Mather, dating Paul Pottinger ’90, and working for Harvard Student Agencies. They may not have known she was always writing on the side as an undergraduate, but it would be impossible to ignore now—with three dozen romance novels and a deal with Shonda Rhimes and Netflix that led to the series everyone was streaming during the pandemic. Living in Seattle with  (now husband) Paul, Pottinger shares why she stays connected to Harvard and how an early rejection of her work was her ticket to the Yard.</p>

			<p><b>See What's she has written about:</b></p><br>
			<p>I had good grades, good scores, took challenging classes, but so does everybody, right? But there was one thing that was different about me, and it was that when I was a teenager, I wrote a romance novel. There was a question on the Harvard application the year I applied: you could list five or 10 books that meant a lot to you, or you could choose one and write about it. So, I chose the book I wrote myself and talked about the experience of writing it and having it rejected.
			I wrote it for Sweet Dreams, which published Harlequin-like romances for teens. I had sent it off to them when I was 16 with what I thought was a very good cover letter. I talked about how I was a teenager myself, and thus I felt that they would find it authentic. It was rejected so quickly I know there is no way they actually read it. I mean, no one gets rejected out of a slush pile in under a month. I’m sure someone saw my age and thought—this can’t be any good.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Writing is a kind of muscle. Yes, there are some people who I think are born storytellers or fiction writers, and there are certain aspects of voice that can't be taught. But you have to know how to write a proper sentence. You have to learn how then to vary the sentence structure. You need to make sure your sentences don't go on too long. You need to know what the rules are so you know when you can break them. And writing paper after paper after paper is incredibly good practice for going on to write a novel.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I think the biggest reason is just the people I met there. (I married one of them!) They're so interesting and diverse in interest and background, and it is just such a dynamic place. I remember thinking while walking through the Square: The world is at my feet. There’s just an energy there that is so exciting and fun.</p>
